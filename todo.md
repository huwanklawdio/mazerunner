- [x] Transform game to medieval dungeon theme with knight character
- [x] Implement particle effects system
- [x] Add wall collision particles (stone debris)
- [x] Add footstep dust particles
- [x] Add victory celebration effects (gold sparkles)
- [x] Add portal effects for start/end positions
- [ ] Add torch flame particles for dungeon atmosphere
- [ ] Optimize performance

## üìù Notes
- Grid-based movement
