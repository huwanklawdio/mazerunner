## üìù Notes
- Grid-based movement
- Pure navigation (no enemies)  
- Pixel art style
- Web browser target
- 4x screen size map
- Randomized maze each game

## üß™ Testing Guidelines
- Create comprehensive tests whenever implementing new features
- Test files should be placed in the `/tests` directory
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Performance tests should validate optimizations don't break functionality
- Critical tests should cover: movement, collision, collection, puzzles
